**About Martha's Little Space on the Internet**


Welcome to Martha's Little Space in the Internet! I created this website at the age of 17 as part of the Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program in 2023. This project showcases my dedication to computer science, math, and physics, reflecting my journey and growth in these fields.

The homepage provides an introduction to my interests and includes a personal touch with my favorite song. It’s designed to offer a glimpse into my creative side and passions.

In the portfolio section, you’ll find:


-> Prizes: Highlights from various academic and writing competitions where I’ve been recognized for my achievements.


-> Courses and Workshops: A detailed account of the educational programs and workshops I’ve completed, including the Kode with Klossy curriculum and other significant learning experiences.

The design features a modern, clean layout with a pink background, ensuring a user-friendly experience. My goal with this site is to share my journey and growth, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
